comments:
  - Please pass CI

# 1. What are the best features of this code?
# - It uses if statement

# 2.Is the code well-documented?
# - Didn't see comment. Would be better to add some comments.

# 3.Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?
# - Line 27 seems a bit repetitive, as it has used IF statement in line 23. It could be improved by merging
# - the conditions together.

# 4. Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style consistent throughout?
# Yes it does.

#  5. If you suspect an error in the code, suggest a particular situation in which the program will not function correctly.
# No error appears after running the test. In conclusion, this function works.
