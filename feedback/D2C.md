A good submission for all parts of D2C.

Code quality was typically quite good, however in task two remember to avoid repeat conditional checks such as on lines `Metro.java:23-27` as well as `Metro.java:28-29`.

Great work on the Viewer for the program. Would be good to see the Viewer program by default without needing to enter a placement string.
