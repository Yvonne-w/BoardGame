Hard to tell what `testGoodShape` and `testGoodLocation` are doing in that they appear to operate on empty strings.
Your tests also do not compile, as you listed your helper as a 'Rule' but did not fulfill the requirements of a rule.
While your tests do supplement the tile well-formedness tests, it would be good to see a more advanced exercise being
attempted.

A good suite of tests for your tile encoding functionality in the `Tile` class. Would however be good to see better
documentation in both your method names for your test methods, as well as throughout your code in `Tile`, as it is not
entirely clear what the `int[]` encoding does. Good example of targeted unit testing for custom code.

# General Comment

Remember to incorporate more OOP practice in your code - not just static but also instance methods for custom objects.
