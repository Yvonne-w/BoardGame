 - Well planned + rehearsed

 - Engaging, a clear summary of the project

Great layout of the presentation, with a live demo first, and a good overview / introduction slide.

Great pacing, although leaving a small break between sections would maybe help people follow the flow of your presentation.

 - Outstanding

Would be good to talk through how the AI uses the formula applied for your greedy algorithm. I understand roughly how it works, but explaining what a static evaluation heuristic might be helpful for your audience.

Great use of graphics in your summary slide!
