# D2F Comment

JAR file runs as expected. Healthy use of version control and comments with authorship details are all present. For
more marks, make sure to meet all components of the deliverable by including comments on either performance details of
your code or of your program's limitations.

# Review Comments
 
Full marks are rewarded for a combination of both general feedback as well as specific comments on how the author may
improve their code, or insights that indicate that you have learned something in reviewing their code. Too many general
comments can often be hard to sift through for the original author.

Remember to be considerate when reflecting on other student's code.
